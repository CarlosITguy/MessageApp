# MessageApp
Baron, I didn't start the messaging app on a git repository and I just copy-pasted 
I think it might have problems running for the folder change I am trying to fix it but still, a work in progress in the mid-time the app is functional and can send and receive messages, it's actualized each time someone sends a message, and have login access, just then for now  to access to the next page is when you have the wrong access for you to don't have to put the password and key correctly
